        <br>
        <p>Lutong Bahay ni Qwinzy began with a simple dream—to share the comforting flavors of Filipino home-cooked meals with the community. It all started in a small kitchen, where Qwinzy, a passionate cook, would prepare meals for family and friends. The joy and satisfaction of seeing their smiles after every meal sparked the idea to bring these dishes to a wider audience. <br>
            <br>
        Inspired by traditional recipes passed down through generations, Qwinzy decided to create a place where everyone could enjoy authentic Filipino food, just like how it’s made at home. With a deep love for cooking and a commitment to quality, Lutong Bahay ni Qwinzy opened its doors, offering a menu filled with classic dishes, snacks, and desserts that reflect the heart of Filipino culture. <br>
            <br>
        From the hearty Kare-Kare to the sweet and crispy Turon, every dish is made with care, using fresh ingredients and time-tested methods. Over time, the humble eatery grew into a beloved spot for people looking for delicious and comforting meals. <br>
            <br>
        Today, Lutong Bahay ni Qwinzy continues its mission of celebrating Filipino flavors, creating a space where every customer feels at home with every bite. What started as a simple dream is now a place where tradition, love, and good food come together to bring people closer.</p>
